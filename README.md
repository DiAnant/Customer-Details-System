# Customer-Details-System
A Full-Stack CRUD Web Application made using React.js &amp; Java Spring-Boot


Need to do following steps:-

1. Show proper messages with UNAUTHORIZED exceptions. Read about the whole thing here - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/73746955/spring-boot-custom-exception-showing-most-peculiar-behavior
2. Validate APIs.
3. Document APIs.
4. Enable CSRF and send token as a header.
5. Make spring security work with ReactJS (connect them)
6. Enable login session system in REACT, so that it can keep track of current user and stuff like that until the user is logged out.
7. Move the Buttons to Navbar - in React.
8. Add a logout button to UI - in React.
9. Try to understand spring security work-flow somewhat, what's really happening.
